# Frontend-Backend Integration Guide

Complete guide for integrating the Next.js frontend with the Spring Boot backend.

## üîó Overview

This guide walks you through connecting the Next.js frontend to the Spring Boot backend to create a fully functional transcript management system with **multi-section teacher support**.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Java 17+ installed
- Maven 3.6+ installed
- Both projects set up (see main README.md)

## üéì NEW: Teacher-Section-Student Management

This system now supports **multi-section management** where:
- **Teachers** can manage multiple class sections
- **Students** can be enrolled in multiple sections
- **Transcripts** can be filtered by section for scoped access
- **Analytics** can be viewed per-section or globally

### Architecture Overview

```
Teacher ‚Üí Manages Multiple Sections
Section ‚Üí Contains Multiple Students
Student ‚Üí Enrolled in Multiple Sections ‚Üí Has One Transcript
```

### Database Schema

**New Tables:**
- `teacher` - Teacher information and user account mapping
- `section` - Course sections with teacher assignments
- `student_section` - Junction table for student enrollments
- `user` - Extended with `role` (STUDENT/TEACHER/ADMIN) and `teacherId`

### Demo Data

The system comes pre-loaded with:

**Teachers:**
- Alice Teacher (alice.teacher@university.edu) - Teaches Math101 (S1) and Physics201 (S2)
- Bob Teacher (bob.teacher@university.edu) - Teaches Biology301 (S3)

**Students:**
- S001 (Alice Johnson) - Enrolled in Math101 (S1)
- S002 (Bob Smith) - Enrolled in Math101 (S1)
- S003 (Carol White) - Enrolled in Biology301 (S3)

## üîß Configuration

### Backend Configuration (application.properties)

```properties
# Server Configuration
server.port=8080

# CORS Configuration (handled in CorsConfig.java)
# Allows: http://localhost:3000

# File Storage
app.data.file=src/main/resources/data/transcripts.json
```

### Frontend Configuration

**API Base URL** (src/app/dashboard/page.tsx):
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts";
```

**Section APIs** (built-in):
- `/api/sections` - Get all sections
- `/api/sections/:id` - Get section details
- `/api/sections/:sectionId/students` - Manage student enrollments
- `/api/students/:studentId/sections` - Get student's sections
- `/api/teachers` - Teacher management

**Authentication:**
All section and teacher APIs require authentication via bearer token.

## üêõ Common Integration Issues

### Issue 1: CORS Error

**Symptom:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts/create' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' 
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify backend `CorsConfig.java` includes `http://localhost:3000`
2. Restart backend server
3. Clear browser cache

### Issue 2: Section Data Not Loading

**Symptom:**
```
Failed to load sections
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify authentication is working (check localStorage for bearer_token)
2. Check browser console for detailed error messages
3. Verify database has seeded section data
4. Test section API directly: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/sections -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`

### Issue 3: Student Not Found in Section

**Symptom:**
```
Access denied: Student not in this section
```

**Solution:**
1. This is expected behavior when viewing a student not enrolled in the selected section
2. Select "All Sections" to view any student
3. Verify student enrollment via: `GET /api/students/{studentId}/sections`

### Issue 4: Connection Refused

**Symptom:**
```
Failed to fetch
net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify backend is running on port 8080
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Test backend directly: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts`

### Issue 5: 401 Unauthorized on Section APIs

**Symptom:**
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/sections 401 (Unauthorized)
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify user is logged in
2. Check localStorage for bearer_token
3. Try logging out and back in
4. Check browser console for authentication errors

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Backend Debugging

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Backend console shows:
   üéì University Transcript System Started!
   üì° API available at: http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts
   üîÑ Initializing demo data...
   ‚úÖ Demo data loaded successfully!
   ```

2. **Test Endpoints with curl:**
   ```bash
   # Get all transcripts
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts
   
   # Get specific transcript
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts/S001
   
   # Create transcript
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"studentId":"TEST001","studentName":"Test","email":"test@edu","major":"CS"}'
   ```

3. **Check Data File:**
   ```bash
   # View stored data
   cat backend/src/main/resources/data/transcripts.json
   ```

### Frontend Debugging

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for JavaScript errors or failed network requests

2. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Open DevTools > Network
   - Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
   - Verify request URLs and responses
   - Check Authorization headers are present

3. **Verify Section State:**
   ```typescript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.getItem('bearer_token') // Should have a token
   ```

4. **Check Database Studio:**
   - Click "Database Studio" tab in top-right corner
   - Verify tables: teacher, section, student_section exist
   - Check data is seeded correctly

## üìä Data Flow

### Create Transcript with Section Assignment
```
1. User selects section in dropdown
2. User fills create form
3. Frontend POST /api/transcripts/create (Spring Boot)
4. Backend creates transcript, returns student data
5. Frontend POST /api/sections/{sectionId}/students (Next.js)
6. Student enrolled in selected section
7. Success message displayed
```

### View Transcript with Section Filtering
```
1. User selects section filter
2. User enters student ID
3. Frontend checks GET /api/sections/{sectionId}/students
4. If student not in section ‚Üí Access denied
5. If student in section ‚Üí GET /api/transcripts/{studentId}
6. Frontend fetches GET /api/students/{studentId}/sections
7. Display transcript with section badges
```

### Section Management Flow
```
Teacher Login ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Section Dropdown Populated ‚Üí 
Select Section ‚Üí All operations scoped to that section ‚Üí
Create/View/Update filtered by section
```

## üîê Security & Access Control

### Section-Based Access

The system implements section-based access control:

1. **Teacher Assignment:** Each section is assigned to a teacher
2. **Student Enrollment:** Students are enrolled in specific sections
3. **Filtered Views:** Teachers only see students in their assigned sections
4. **Access Checks:** Transcript access validated against section enrollment

### Implementation

```typescript
// Frontend checks before viewing transcript
if (selectedSectionId !== "all") {
  const sectionStudents = await fetch(`/api/sections/${sectionId}/students`);
  const isInSection = sectionStudents.some(s => s.studentId === studentId);
  
  if (!isInSection) {
    toast.error("Access denied: Student not in this section");
    return;
  }
}
```

### Backend Notes

For full section-scoped access control on the Spring Boot side:
1. Add `?sectionId=X` parameter to transcript endpoints
2. Filter transcript queries by section enrollment
3. Add teacher authentication and authorization
4. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

## üåê Production Deployment

### Update Backend CORS for Production

In `CorsConfig.java`:
```java
registry.addMapping("/api/**")
    .allowedOrigins(
        "http://localhost:3000",  // Development
        "https://your-app.vercel.app"  // Production
    )
    .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS")
    .allowedHeaders("*")
    .allowCredentials(true);
```

### Update Frontend API URL for Production

Create `.env.production`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api/transcripts
```

Update `dashboard/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:8080/api/transcripts";
```

## üìö Database Management

### Access Database Studio

1. Click "Database Studio" tab (top-right corner of the page)
2. View and manage all tables:
   - `user` - User accounts with roles
   - `teacher` - Teacher information
   - `section` - Course sections
   - `student_section` - Student enrollments
3. Run SQL queries directly
4. Export/import data

### Useful Queries

```sql
-- View all teachers with section counts
SELECT t.*, COUNT(s.id) as section_count 
FROM teacher t 
LEFT JOIN section s ON t.id = s.teacherId 
GROUP BY t.id;

-- View students by section
SELECT ss.studentId, s.name as sectionName, s.sectionCode 
FROM student_section ss 
JOIN section s ON ss.sectionId = s.id;

-- View sections with student counts
SELECT s.*, COUNT(ss.studentId) as student_count 
FROM section s 
LEFT JOIN student_section ss ON s.id = ss.sectionId 
GROUP BY s.id;
```
